I am attending App Academy later in 2014 and in the meantime am learning iOS development as a complementary skillset to the Ruby / Rails / Javascript I will be learning at App Academy

Some of the best resources I have seen so far:

* "Try Objective-C" on Code School
* Treehouse iOS track
* Stanford iOS App development course with Paul Hegarty (through iTunes U)
* "Start Developing iOS Apps Today" from the Apple Developer Library

In particular the last resource from Apple itself is by far the best, I would highly recommend sitting down with a coffee and a printout of the PDF from Appleâ€™s website and working through the materials in an afternoon.

Happy coding!
