<h2>About Me</h2>

I am primarily a JavaScript developer (currently leveling up big time at Hack Reactor) but also like playing with Ruby on Rails and other cool open source web languages and frameworks. Prior to pursuing software development I worked as a junior capital markets investment banker in Hong Kong, and I speak fluent Mandarin Chinese. For fun, I like to run marathons and play the cello.
