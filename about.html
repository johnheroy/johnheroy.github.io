<h2>About Me</h2>

I am primarily a JavaScript developer but also like playing with bash scripts, Ruby on Rails, and other cool open source web languages and frameworks. Prior to pursuing software development I worked as a junior capital markets investment banker in Hong Kong, and I speak fluent Mandarin Chinese. For fun, I like to run marathons and play the cello.
